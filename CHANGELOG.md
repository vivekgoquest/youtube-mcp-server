## Release Process

This project uses semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH** version for backwards compatible bug fixes

To create a new release:
```bash
npm version patch  # for bug fixes
npm version minor  # for new features
npm version major  # for breaking changes
```

This will automatically:
1. Update the version in package.json
2. Create a git tag
3. Trigger GitHub Actions to publish to NPM
4. Create a GitHub release
